## Introduction

Data structures store data based on your needs. The type of data structure to use will depend on the application. Data structures often differ based on:

1. time to populate the data structure.
2. time to add/find elements.
3. the size of the structure in memory.

## Binary Search

## Binary Search Trees

Binary Search Trees are node-based binary tree data structures. They have the following properties:
- The left subtree contains lesser values
- The right subtree contains greater values
- The left/right subtree must be binary search trees
