## Introduction

Data structures store data based on your needs. The type of data structure to use will depend on the application. Data structures often differ based on:

1. time to populate the data structure.
2. time to add/find elements.
3. the size of the structure in memory.

## Binary Search Trees
Binary Search Trees are node-based binary tree data structures. They are tree-like structures with a single root at the very top. They have the following properties:

- every left child has a smaller value than its parent
- every right child has a larger value than its parent
- eveery node can contain from 0 to 2 children

We can define a Binary Tree Node with the following function:

  function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
