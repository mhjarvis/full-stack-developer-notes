/* Hash Tables

Depending on the language, these are refered to by many different names (e.g. maps, hash maps, dictionaries, associative arrays, etc.). Hash Table is a list of paired values. The first item is the 'key' and the second item is the 'value'.

Efficiency:

Hash Tables can be used to look up data in O(1) time.
