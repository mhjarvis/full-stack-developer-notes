/* Hash Tables

Depending on the language, these are refered to by many different names (e.g. maps, hash maps, dictionaries, associative arrays, etc.). Hash Table is a list of paired values. The first item is the 'key' and the second item is the 'value'. These have a significant association with each other. 'Hashing' is similar to the decypher code used when playing as kids to decypher notes. 

** Hash function need to meet only one criterion to be valid: a hash function must convert the same string to the same number every single time it's applied. 

Efficiency:

Hash Tables can be used to look up data in O(1) time.
