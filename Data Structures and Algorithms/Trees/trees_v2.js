// Two types of search related to trees:

// Depth-First-Search - starts at the initial node and goes deepter into the tree until it reaches
// an element without children - a leaf. Then it backtracks and visits the most recent node
// that has not yet been explored.

// Breadth-First Search - starts from the root node and first traverses all the neighboring nodes.
// Then it selects the nearest node and explores the new nodes.
