## Setting Up Webpack

[The Odin Project Link](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page)

A. Start the project:

  1. Run ```npm init``` in your project directory to generate a ```package.json``` file.

B. Run ```npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev``` to install webpack to the node_modules directory of your project.

    Quick tip: the node_modules folder can get really big. It is customary to add a .gitignore file to your project so that you don’t have to sync the contents of node_modules to github. The dependencies that are stored there can be installed from your package.json by running npm install, so you don’t need to sync them.

C. Create a ```src``` and ```dist``` directory with the following contents:

  1. An ```index.js``` file in ```src```.

  2. An ```index.html``` file in ```dist```. Go ahead and link the ```main.js``` file in a script tag. ```main.js``` is the file that will be generated by webpack.

  3. Create a ```webpack.config.js``` file that looks just like our file from the [tutorial](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/#using-a-configuration):

  4. In the webpack.config.js file:

      ```const path = require('path');
      module.exports = {
        entry: './src/index.js',
        output: {
          filename: 'main.js',
          path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        },
      };      
  5. Run the build again with ```npx webpack --config.js```.

  6. Set up an HTML skeleton inside of dist/index.html with single ```<div id="content">```.

  7. Inside of src/index.js write a simple console.log or alert statement and then run npx webpack. Load up dist/index.html in a browser to make sure everything is working correctly.

    Quick tip #2: if you run npx webpack --watch you will not have to rerun webpack every time you make a change.
